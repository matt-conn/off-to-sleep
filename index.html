                    <!-- <h1>Hi, I'm Lindsay!</h1> -->

                    <p style="text-align: center;">I became a trained certified sleep consultant soon after realizing the tremendous benefits of helping my older son master his own sleeping routine, while his newborn sister tried to do the same in her bedroom next door. We thought he’d somehow just “figure it out” despite the transition of having a new sibling, in a new home with a new bed, while starting a new pre-school. 
                    Boy, were we wrong! Our struggles and trials led me down a path of hit-or-miss strategies, then more focused research, eventual success, and finally to structured coursework and sleep training certification that provides the basis for Off To Sleep.

                <h2>Let's Take the First Steps Together</h2>
                <p>If your baby or toddler is not sleeping, I invite you to schedule a complimentary initial consultation with me, at your convenience. If you're like most people, you’ll have plenty of questions, and I probably will too, as we zero in on your specific circumstances, goals and needs.</p>
                
                <p>Since every child is different, and every parent (and parenting style) is too, I will take all the time we need to develop an informed, customized sleep plan based on state-of-the-art scientific, psychological, environmental (and other) disciplines. My multidisciplinary plan is both structured and flexible, and if you’d like, I will remain by your side through whatever adjustments or revisions are needed.</p>
                
                <p>I understand how highly personal the process is, and there is nothing cookie-cutter about my approach. Some of my clients are with me for a few hours or day, some for weeks, others longer. We’ll figure it out and do whatever you tell me you need.</p>

                <h2>More About Me</h2>
                <p>Before becoming a wife and mother, I earned my undergraduate degree in Marketing and completed my Masters coursework in Corporate Communications, and worked in NYC for years in healthcare management,  communications and advertising. My classroom and professional roles all demonstrated the essential need for thorough assessment, preparation, communication and follow-through in any successful collaboration or endeavor. Parenting (and sleep training) is certainly no different or easier.</p>
                
                <p>Today nothing brings me more joy than watching my own children thrive, and my decision to leave my corporate roles to launch <strong>Off To Sleep</strong> was surprisingly easy for me, based firmly in my dedication to guide and support parents who simply want what all loving parents want: the knowledge, tools and support they need to ensure the very best and balanced start for their little ones.</p>

If you are still pregnant we can talk about what you can do from day zero to set your baby up for success. If you newborn is still under 12 weeks of age and you are just looking to get some tips on how to help your baby, this is also probably the best starting-off option for you.

She was so patient, helpful, understanding, and attentive to his specific needs. He usually slept around 7-8 hours a night - which sounded great in theory - but we knew he needed more. With her help, we were able to get him to sleep 11-12 hours a night consistently, within about 1.5 weeks of working with Lindsay. She made something that felt so daunting so very easy! We are forever grateful for her!</p>

Honestly, if it weren't for her, my now 9-month-old would probably still be waking me up every couple of hours throughout the night. Lindsay is so patient and was great about working with my family's schedule. She works her magic without any judgement and stayed on top of me throughout our sleep training journey. Thank you Lindsay!</p>
